            <h2>Parks are generally considered to be environmentally beneficial, but we can often overlook the local climactic effects of parks on surrounding communities. This page provides a sampling of important effects of parks with a focus on the particular example of Atlanta’s recently constructed Westside Reservoir park. </h2>

                    <p>An important characteristic of the greenery in parks is that it has a low albedo or reflectivity value. Greenery tends to be dark in color and thus tends to absorb larger parts of the visible light spectrum than other lighter or more reflective materials such as snow or concrete. This would lead one to assume that the increased amount of greenery brought in by a park may result in warmer temperatures in an area as the plant life, heated up by the sun, radiates out the warmth that it took in. However there are two major flaws in this idea.  </p>
                    <p>The first of these flaws would be that the area where a park is being built is often an area where there was once roadways, and this is true of westside park. Roadways and other dark construction materials tend to have very low albedo, frequently lower than that of greenery. Additionally bright colored surfaces in urban environments tend to get dirty without careful maintenance which drastically reduces their albedo. </p>
                    <p>Another flaw here is that plants perform photosynthesis, which converts some of the energy they receive from the sun into sugars and promotes the further growth of plant matter. This means that some of the energy absorbed by the greenery is not radiated back out to heat the environment. It is hard to the absolute differences in heating between green spaces and urbanized spaces due to this one effect but along with other effects this difference can contribute to urban heat island which can have profound effects and is discussed in a later section.  </p>
                    <p>However, an important item to note is that increased plant matter contributes to slowing climate change on a global scale, and when viewed from this perspective the plant matter could over time contribute to slowing the rise in average temperatures at the local level as well.  </p>

                    <p>Clouds are the result of suspended water particles in the air and require a sufficiently high relative humidity to coerce vapor to condense out of the air. Fog is nothing but a cloud at ground level. Thus, fog formation requires an area of high relative humidity to form. One source of humidity for this can be ponds and lakes.</p>
                    <p>Although fog can form in many ways one type that is particularly associated with lakes such as the Westside Reservoir lake is advection fog. To form this fog, water from the lake, which is warmer than the surrounding air at night due to the heat capacity of water, evaporates to create a moist, warm layer of air. Then a breeze carries this fog over cooler land (which has cooled off quickly during the night), which cools the air below it’s dew point, which results in the condensation of water out of the air to form a cloud at surface level, otherwise known as fog. The foggiest area in the United States, aptly named Cape Disappointment sees thick advection fog for most days of the year.  </p>
                    <p>A similar formation process forms Evaporation or Mixing fog. To form this fog, water from the lake, which is warmer than the surrounding air at night due to the heat capacity of water, evaporates to create a moist, warm layer of air. Then a slight breeze mixes this warm layer into colder air, which brings the moist air below its dew point to force the condensation of water out of the air.  </p>
                    <p>We can see the results of these fog formation methods in Atlanta’s historical weather, where we frequently observe fog more than 10 days in a month in the Atlanta area, particularly in the winter. Given this, it may be smart to avoid building large water bodies near largely populated areas, particularly in areas where it may bring fog towards roads and traffic. </p>

                    <p>A particularly important factor in the climate of urban cityscapes is the Urban Heat Island Effect. The urban heat island effect is a phenomenon in which urbanized areas experience much warmer temperatures in the range of 2-7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than those measured in nearby rural areas. The urban heat island effect has a multitude of causes, including but not limited to, urban material choice, anthropogenic heat, and urban geometry.  </p>
                    <p>Urban materials tend to reflect less and absorb and emit more solar radiation than natural materials such as trees, grass, lakes, and other plant life as was mentioned in the previous section. This causes them to heat up to very high temperatures over the day and heat the air with an effect that adds up over the course of the day. Additionally, natural landscapes offer plants and water sources which provide cooling through transpiration and evaporation respectively.  </p>
                    <p>Anthropogenic heat sources are anything we do that generates heat. This includes all power and fuel consuming devices including but not limited to refrigerators, computers, cars, heating and cooling systems, datacenters, and toasters. These contribute significantly to the local heating when wind is weak and thus air mixing is limited.  </p>
                    <p>Urban geometries tend to block wind which keeps the heat trapped in the urban heat island. In the night this results in what is known as a temperature inversion which further prevents mixing. In addition to wind blocking effects, urban geometries tend to have limited shade when compared to green areas which give smaller surface areas for heating.  </p>
                    <p>Parks can provide some alleviation to this urban heat island effect, breaking up heat traps and providing cooling effects. For this reason parks near urban areas such as Westside Reservoir Park can be invaluable in warmer regions such as the southeastern united states.  </p>
